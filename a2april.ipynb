    "The purpose of grid search CV (Cross-Validation) in machine learning is to systematically search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but set prior to training and can significantly impact the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV works by defining a grid of hyperparameter values to explore. It exhaustively evaluates all possible combinations of hyperparameters by training and evaluating the model using cross-validation. Cross-validation is used to estimate the model's performance on unseen data by dividing the available data into multiple subsets (folds). Each fold is used as a validation set, and the model is trained on the remaining folds. This process is repeated for each combination of hyperparameters, and the performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) is recorded. Finally, the combination of hyperparameters that yielded the best performance metric is selected as the optimal configuration for the model."

    "The main difference between grid search CV and randomized search CV is the way they explore the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In grid search CV, a predefined grid of hyperparameter values is created, and all possible combinations are exhaustively evaluated. It explores the entire parameter space defined by the grid. This approach is suitable when the search space is relatively small and the computational resources are available to evaluate all combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, randomized search CV randomly selects a subset of hyperparameter combinations from a predefined distribution. It does not evaluate all possible combinations but rather samples a fixed number of configurations. This method is useful when the hyperparameter search space is large, as it can be computationally expensive to exhaustively evaluate all combinations. Randomized search CV offers a good trade-off between exploration and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between grid search CV and randomized search CV depends on the size of the search space, available computational resources, and the desired balance between exploration and efficiency."

    "Data leakage refers to a situation where information from outside the training data is used inappropriately during the model training process, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates or biased models.

    "\n",
    "Splitting Data Properly: Ensure that the data is divided into distinct sets for training, validation, and testing. The test set should be completely independent and not used in any part of the model development process until the final evaluation.\n",
